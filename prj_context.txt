PROJECT NAME: swisscarexport.ch

This project is a Nuxt 3 (Vue) web platform for exporting used cars from Switzerland to buyers abroad.

GOAL:
Create a simple, affordable, multilingual marketplace focused ONLY on exporting used cars out of Switzerland (Eastern Europe, Balkans, Africa, etc.). The platform targets cheap, small, affordable cars.

CORE FEATURES:
- Public browsing without login
- Two user types: Seller and Buyer
- Sellers list cars for export only
- Two listing types:
  1) Normal listing
  2) Auction / bidding 
- Buyers can chat with sellers
- Real-time AI translation inside chat
- Phone number visible for sellers
- Wallet-based system for posting fees
- Mobile-first design

BUSINESS RULES:
- Normal listing: 7.5 CHF
- Auction listing: 10 CHF
- First 6 months free for sellers
- Later: 5–10 CHF per car sold
- Users can receive free starter credit
- Wallet balance is reduced when posting
- Only cars being exported out of Switzerland are allowed

TRUST & SECURITY:
- Buyers who bid must authenticate with ID
- If a buyer bids and does not complete purchase → banned
- Ban applies to future accounts as well
- Users are warned about this during signup

TRANSPORT LOGIC:
- Seller selects Swiss canton for initial transport
- Buyer selects destination country
- System calculates two transport legs

LANGUAGES:
- English (base)
- Add: Polish, Albanian, Italian, Czech
- Remove: Greek, Russian
- All locale keys must match en.json

ADMIN (NOT FULLY IMPLEMENTED YET):
- Add/remove user funds
- Remove listings
- Ban users
- Moderate content

KNOWN ISSUES:
- Sorting on cars page is broken
- Language switch sometimes doesn’t work
- Profile page wallet & stats incomplete
- Button color contrast issues
- Auction UX unfinished

TECH STACK:
- Nuxt 3 / Vue
- Nitro server routes
- JWT authentication
- Entities: User, Car, Bid, Chat, Message

Current task: I will send you specific files and ask you to debug, improve, or implement missing features based on this context.


to do: make sure that only verified users can post, text, and bid, unverified ones can only view. and in the signup page i want to add the requirement of the ID, which will be attached to the user in the admin page so the admin can see and verify the user
fix the issue in the profile page where the data isnt gotten correctly.
